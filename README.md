##ðŸ“Œ What is a Network Sniffer?

A Network Sniffer is a tool that monitors network traffic and captures packets for analysis. These tools are used for identifying security issues, analyzing performance, or testing and development purposes.

<h1>âš¡ How Does It Work?</h1>

1. The program listens to a network interface.


2. It captures incoming and outgoing packets.


3. It analyzes packet content, including source and destination addresses, protocols used, and transmitted data.


4. It presents the captured data in a readable format.



##ðŸ”§ Requirements

Programming Language: Python (or alternatives like C or Go).

Libraries such as scapy or socket in Python.


##ðŸ›  How to Use

1. Run the program with administrator privileges (sudo on Linux/Mac or admin mode on Windows).


2. Select the network interface (e.g., eth0 or wlan0).


3. Capture and analyze network packets.



##âš  Important Notes

Ensure legal usage; intercepting network traffic without permission is illegal in many countries.

It can be used for ethical hacking, network monitoring, and cybersecurity research.
